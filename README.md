## Common Questions

### **Is Leaf Lag Switch detectable by Byfron?**

**No.**
Byfron only detects exploits that directly interact with the Roblox process (Injecting Dlls, memory editing). Leaf Lag Switch does not interact with the Roblox client, it only changes Windows firewall rules. As a result, it cannot by detected by Byfron.


### **Is this a virus?**

**No. It is not at all. If you want you can go copy and paste the code inside of leaflag.py into chatgpt and ask it yourself if the code has a virus.** 
Leaf Lag Switch is open source. You can review the code and compile it yourself if you don't trust.
